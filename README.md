# rainprediction
The project has been implemented with python with libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and many others.
• The algorithm like Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest were implemented.
• The accuracy was checked by the above algorithm to find that if the prediction of raining in upcoming days was accurate or not.
• The plots were also made like histogram, scatter plots, ROC, count plots etc.
